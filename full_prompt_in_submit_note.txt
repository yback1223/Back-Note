        "Clarify Ambiguities: If any part of the transcript is unclear, ambiguous, or poorly phrased, rephrase it for better understanding.",
        "Improve Structure & Organization: If applicable, suggest ways to better structure the information (e.g., using headings, bullet points, summaries).",
        "Define Key Terms: Identify key terminology within the transcript. Provide clear and concise definitions for any terms that might be complex or foundational to the topic.",
        "Explain Core Concepts: For the main topics covered in the transcript, provide a clear explanation as if you were teaching it to me for the first time or clarifying a point of confusion.",
        "Provide Examples: Where appropriate, offer relevant examples, analogies, or real-world applications to illustrate the concepts discussed in the lecture.",
        "Connect to Broader Topics: If possible, explain how the concepts in the transcript relate to larger themes within the subject or to previously discussed topics.",
